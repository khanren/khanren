## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-time BSc (Hons) Information Technology (Computer Networking and Security) student at Sunway University and a Cybersecurity Analyst at Delta Spike Asia Sdn Bhd, where my bachelor's degree is sponsored.

Passionate about cybersecurity, I am pursuing a career in purple teams and enjoy working on practical projects to solve real-world problems. I have a positive outlook and love meeting new people, collaborating, and learning. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, music, and watching Hollywood, Sci-Fi, horror, and action movies.

I'm enthusiastic about the future of cybersecurity and always seeking new ways to stay updated. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential collaborations or to connect!
